6. OUTREACH HIGHLIGHTS 
As part of the December 2024 Medical Outreach conducted by the Joseph Penawou Foundation in Akugbene, Delta State, I designed and developed a series of interconnected dashboards to provide a real-time, visual representation of operations, patient data, diagnoses, treatments, and services rendered. Each reporting sheet was customized to meet the specific needs of both clinical staff and program managers.
 1. Services Rendered Board
This analysis consolidated all the services provided across departments. It showed:
•	503 FBS and 503 RBS screenings, allowing blood sugar monitoring at scale.
•	744 orthopedic services, including lumbar braces (453), crutches (150), walkers (131), and wheelchairs (10).
•	501 dental procedures, with scaling/polishing (401) being the most common.
•	1,262 eyeglasses distributed, demonstrating the significant optical support provided.
•	Screening results for Hepatitis B and RVS, each testing over 500 patients.
This analysis helped the coordination team understand the scope of direct interventions and identify the most utilized services during the outreach.

2. Diagnosis & Treatment Board
Focused on clinical assessments and diagnostic trends, this analysis included:
•	1,846 laboratory investigations, with malaria parasite tests topping the list (960).
•	841 scans, mainly abdominal (746) and chest X-rays (90).
•	Disease-specific breakdowns for hypertension (541), diabetes mellitus (500), and peptic ulcer disease (459).
•	A visual pie chart of positive/negative malaria results, and bar graphs for other diseases.
The analysis supported the medical team in identifying prevalent conditions and guiding treatment priorities.

 3. Doctor’s Board
Tailored for each doctor, this analysis displayed:
•	Total patients seen (e.g., 19 patients for Dr. Hope Imegbemosun).
•	Common diagnoses like malaria, diabetes, hypertension, and peptic ulcer disease.
•	Age ranges of patients seen, helping with trend analysis.
•	127 drugs prescribed, showing the doctor’s clinical impact.
This tool enabled physician-level performance reviews and facilitated follow-ups.

4. Nurse’s Board
This analysis tracked preliminary patient screenings and vitals, including:
•	1,000 patients screened by nurses.
•	Average physical metrics: weight (75.29 kg), height (169.89 cm), and pulse (79.80 bpm).
•	BP checks completed for all 1,000 patients.
It highlighted the essential role nurses played in early detection and triaging.

 5. Patient Demographics Board
This provided detailed population profiling:
•	3,000 total patients, with 1,401 females and 1,599 males.
•	Age breakdown across five bands, with the highest group being ages 31–45 (985 patients).
•	Occupation distribution, showing a high turnout from farmers (733) and traders (710).
•	Additional distribution insights by address (e.g., 896 patients from Akugbene) and referral status.
This analysis was crucial for identifying population reach and tailoring health messaging for future outreaches.


7. Challenges & Resolutions
Challenge	Resolution
Multiple mis-inputs during entry	Extensive cleaning using Excel and Power Query
Inconsistent formats and duplicates	Standardized fields and de-duplicated entries
Data integration across teams	Created unified reporting templates and lookup sheets


8. RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on my hands-on experience and the outcomes of the December outreach, I propose the following improvements to optimize future medical outreach operations and data management:
 1. Adopt Digital Data Collection Tools
Implement mobile-friendly digital forms using platforms like Google Forms, KoboToolbox, ODK, or Airtable. These tools can:
•	Minimize data entry errors with built-in validation
•	Sync data in real time from the field
•	Eliminate the need for manual transcription

 2. Standardize Data Entry Procedures
Before outreach begins, establish a standard operating procedure (SOP) for data entry:
•	Define acceptable formats (e.g., “M” or “Male” only)
•	Use dropdowns or radio buttons instead of free-text fields where possible
•	Provide mock forms or training simulations for volunteers

 3. Conduct Volunteer Training on Data Handling
Organize a pre-outreach orientation session focused on:
•	Accurate data capture
•	Protecting patient privacy
•	Real-time error identification
•	Use of mobile/desktop entry platforms
This will increase data quality and reduce post-event cleaning effort.

 4. Develop a Centralized Data Platform
Consider building a simple centralized data analysis system that can:
•	Pull data live from form responses
•	Provide field leads with on-site summaries
•	Archive past outreach data for comparative analysis
Platforms like Power BI, Tableau Public, or Google Data Studio can be used for this.

 5. Incorporate Performance Tracking for Medical Staff
Maintain dashboards like those built for doctors and nurses to:
•	Monitor daily activity levels
•	Identify gaps in care delivery
•	Recognize high-performing staff for reward or follow-up

 6. Expand Analytics to Include Outcome Measures
Beyond services delivered, future reports should track:
•	Patient follow-up requirements
•	Referral completion rates
•	Outcome improvements (e.g., BP/BS levels pre- vs. post-treatment)
This would offer deeper insights into the impact of the outreach rather than just the volume.


9. Conclusion
The outreach was a success, both operationally and analytically. The data gathered, cleaned, and analyzed have provided key insights into the healthcare needs of the community served. I recommend institutionalizing the analytical approach used here for future outreach programs.
